This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl programming: accessing an array element outside of its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version with error handling.  The error arises from attempting to access an index that does not exist within the array, which can lead to unexpected results or program crashes.
